# Humidity-and-Temperature-Control

â€ƒ

I.	PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project's goal is to protect objects such as archeological objects, contained in a room, keeping them within a range of temperature and humidity to prevent their degradation.
For this, a data acquisition system will be established (temperature and humidity sensor) to detect the humidity and the temperature of the room.
If the temperature or humidity of the room reaches a certain maximum or minimum threshold then an alarm is triggered and a message is sent to the room manager. It will also be possible to follow the evolution of the temperature and humidity of the room through a web application.

II.	Hardware

     1. Piezo buzzer :
          We use for this project, a piezoelectric audio signaling device: Piezo buzzer.
          It will make different sound depend on the value of the temperature and the humidity.


     2. AM2321 Temperature and humidity sensor:
          AM2321 capacitive humidity sensing digital temperature and humidity sensor is a temperature and humidity own calibration digital signal output composite sensor. 
          The sensor includes a capacitive sensor wet components and a high-precision integrated temperature measurement devices, and connected with a high-performance microprocessor.



          Connexion:
                  AM2321 Connexion:
                                 Gray -> VCC
                                 Blue -> GND
                                 Purple -> SDA
                                 Green -> SCL
